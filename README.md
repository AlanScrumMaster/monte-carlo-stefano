# Stefano's Monte Carlo experiemental estimation framework

Stefano Martincigh needed something to evaluate/demonstrate how Monte Carlo simulation could be used to improve Agile estimation.

[Paul "TBBle" Hampson](https://www.tbble.org/) found that Microsoft Excel just wasn't going to be up to the task, and wanted to learn modern Javascript development.

The deployed version will appear at <https://www.tbble.org/monte-carlo-stefano/>
